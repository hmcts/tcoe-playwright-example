# Playwright Project Template

This repository serves as a template for UI test automation using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) within HMCTS. It provides an accelerated set up with multiple browser support, environmental config and sensible defaults. You can simply clone this repo if starting from scratch or copy the parts you would like to use in your test own test project.

## Features

- **Cross-browser testing**: Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Responsive testing**: Test on different viewports (tablet/desktop).
- **Parallel test execution**: Run tests concurrently for faster feedback.
- **Accessibility tests**: Integrate basic accessibility checks using libraries like Axe Core.
- **Performance tests**: Provides an implementation of Lighthouse which can be used for quick feedback on UI performance.
- **CI/CD ready**: Sample Jenkinsfile included for integrating with your CI pipeline.
- **Test tagging**: Use tags like `@a11y` for accessibility, `@smoke` for smoke tests, and more.
- **Structured logging**: Shared Winston logger + API client factory automatically attach sanitised call details to Playwright reports.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern, ensuring that locators and actions are well-organized and reusable.

See the [POM docs](https://github.com/hmcts/tcoe-playwright-example/blob/master/docs/PAGE_OBECT_MODEL.md) for more info

## Contributing

We all share the responsibility of ensuring this repo is up to date and accurate in terms of best practice. If you would like to contribute you can raise a github issue with the improvement you are suggesting or raise a PR yourself. See the [contribution guide](https://github.com/hmcts/tcoe-playwright-example/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (v20.11.1 or later)
- Yarn (Berry)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playwright-template.git
cd playwright-template
yarn install
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests using the Playwright test runner:

```bash
yarn playwright test
```

> `yarn playwright` automatically tidies the local link to `@hmcts/playwright-common` so that Playwright is only required once. This avoids the "Requiring @playwright/test second time" error when developing against the linked package.

Run unit tests that cover shared utilities:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
yarn playwright test tests/specific_test_file.spec.ts
```

To run tests on a specific browser:

```bash
yarn playwright test --project=chrome
yarn playwright test --project=firefox
yarn playwright test --project=webkit
```

### Test Tagging

You can use tags to group tests, for example:

```bash
yarn playwright test --grep @smoke
```

### Debugging Tests

To run tests with tracing, screenshots, and video recording for debugging purposes:

```bash
yarn playwright test --trace on --video on --screenshot on
```

Alternatively, you can use `page.pause()` inside your test whilst in `--headed` mode to pause execution at a specific point.

### Environment configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the blanks. At minimum you need:

```env
# Required user credentials (grab them from Azure KeyVault)
CASEMANAGER_USERNAME=<idam email>
CASEMANAGER_PASSWORD=<password>
JUDGE_USERNAME=<idam email>
JUDGE_PASSWORD=<password>

# IDAM + S2S endpoints (already defaulted for AAT)
IDAM_SECRET=<S2S client secret for your IdAM app (Azure Key Vault)>
CLIENT_ID=<IdAM OAuth2 client id e.g. prl-cos-api>
S2S_SECRET=<S2S microservice secret from Key Vault>
S2S_MICROSERVICE_NAME=<registered microservice name e.g. xui_webapp>
S2S_URL=http://rpe-service-auth-provider-aat.service.core-compute-aat.internal/testing-support/lease
```

Optional logging toggles (defaults shown in the template):

```env
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOG_FORMAT=json
LOG_REDACTION=on
PLAYWRIGHT_DEBUG_API=0
```

Setting `PLAYWRIGHT_DEBUG_API=1` includes raw API payloads in test attachments. Leave it disabled for CI so secrets stay obfuscated.

### Selecting reporters

- Set `PLAYWRIGHT_DEFAULT_REPORTER=list` (or `dot`, `html`, etc.) to control the single reporter that is used when you **don't** specify anything else. The default is `list` locally and `dot` on CI.
- Override the entire reporter list with `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTERS=list,html` (comma-separated). Each entry goes through the same helper shown in `playwright.config.ts` so you can mix built-ins with custom reporters.
- Built-in reporters supported out of the box: `list`, `dot`, `line`, `html`, `junit`.
- To enable [Odhín reports](https://playwright-odhin-reports-1f6b7a95ad42468d7d90f7962fbe172f83b229.gitlab.io/#/v1/install):
  1. Add `odhin-reports-playwright` to `devDependencies`.
  2. Run with `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTERS=odhin` (or pair it with others, e.g. `PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTERS=list,odhin`).
  3. Configure as needed with the environment variables below (defaults in parentheses):
     - `PW_ODHIN_OUTPUT` (`test-results/odhin-report`) – folder where the report is written.
     - `PW_ODHIN_INDEX` (`playwright-odhin.html`) – report filename.
     - `PW_ODHIN_TITLE` (`tcoe-playwright-example Playwright`) – title shown in the UI.
     - `PW_ODHIN_ENV` (`TEST_ENVIRONMENT` or `ci|local`) – environment label in the header.
     - `PW_ODHIN_PROJECT` (`tcoe-playwright-example`) – project name displayed in the report.
     - `PW_ODHIN_RELEASE` (`<package version> | branch=<branch>`) – release metadata.
     - `PW_ODHIN_START_SERVER` (`false`) – set to `true` to auto-serve the report locally and print the URL after each run.
     - `PW_ODHIN_CONSOLE_LOG`/`PW_ODHIN_CONSOLE_ERROR` (`true`) – control reporter stdout/stderr.
     - `PW_ODHIN_TEST_OUTPUT` (`only-on-failure`) – choose when stdout/stderr tabs appear (`true`, `false`, or `only-on-failure`).
     - `PW_ODHIN_API_LOGS` (`api`) – mirror API telemetry to stdout: `off`, `api` (API projects only), or `all`.
     - `PLAYWRIGHT_API_LOG_ATTACH` (`on`) – disable to skip the `api-calls.json` attachment and rely solely on the Odhín stdout tab.
  4. To preview the report automatically, run e.g.  
     ```bash
     PW_ODHIN_START_SERVER=true PLAYWRIGHT_REPORTERS=list,odhin yarn playwright test
     ```
     Otherwise open `test-results/odhin-report/playwright-odhin.html` (or your customised path) manually.

### API Telemetry & Logging

- Use the `createApiClient` fixture to spin up sanitised API clients in your tests. Every call is logged via Winston and attached to your Playwright report as `api-calls.json`.
- Toggle log verbosity through optional environment variables (see the previous section).
- Global setup utilities (`IdamUtils`, `ServiceAuthUtils`) share the same logger and feed telemetry into the same attachment for complete visibility.
- Required secrets:
  - `IDAM_SECRET` – OAuth2 client secret for `CLIENT_ID`, stored in Azure Key Vault.
  - `CLIENT_ID` – OAuth2 client ID for the UI/API under test (defaults to `prl-cos-api` in the template).
  - `S2S_SECRET` – HMCTS Service-to-Service shared secret (fetch from Key Vault).
  - `S2S_MICROSERVICE_NAME` – name registered with the S2S provider (e.g. `xui_webapp`).
  - `S2S_URL` – S2S lease endpoint (defaults to the AAT URL, override per environment).
- Control how much of this telemetry ends up in Odhín: set `PW_ODHIN_API_LOGS=all` (default `api`) to mirror logs to stdout for the report, or `off` to disable it entirely; pair with `PLAYWRIGHT_API_LOG_ATTACH=off` if you want to keep artefacts lean.

#### Concrete usage example

```ts
// playwright-e2e/tests/api/sample.spec.ts
import { expect, test } from "../fixtures";

test.describe("@api smoke checks", () => {
  test("token endpoint returns 200", async ({ createApiClient }) => {
    const client = createApiClient({
      baseUrl: process.env.SERVICE_BASE_URL,
      name: "token-api",
    });

    const { status, data } = await client.post<{ access_token: string }>(
      "/oauth/token",
      {
        data: {
          grant_type: "client_credentials",
          scope: "openid profile",
        },
        throwOnError: true,
      }
    );

    expect(status).toBe(200);
    expect(data.access_token).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

After the test finishes you will see an `api-calls.json` attachment in the Playwright HTML report. Sensitive headers/body fields (`token`, `secret`, `password`, etc.) are automatically masked. Flip `PLAYWRIGHT_DEBUG_API=1` if you need the raw payload locally.

#### Cleaning duplicate Playwright installations

When linked to the local `@hmcts/playwright-common` workspace, Yarn can hoist a second copy of `@playwright/test`. The helper script `yarn playwright …` runs `scripts/cleanup-playwright.mjs` before every test run to replace nested copies with symlinks to the top-level install. You can also execute it manually:

```bash
node scripts/cleanup-playwright.mjs
```

This is safe to run repeatedly (the script is idempotent) and keeps Playwright from complaining about being required twice.

### Accessibility Tests

Run accessibility checks as part of your tests using Axe Core:

```bash
yarn playwright test --grep @a11y
```

### Running in CI

This project currently provides two sample Jenkinsfile's:

- Jenkinsfile_CNP: (Cloud Native Platform) This provides your typical "merge" pipeline. When you have a PR, this is the pipeline that will run. Currently it runs typechecks and linting (with eslint playwright plugin) checks.
- Jenkinsfile_nightly: This is the nightly pipeline that is sheduled to run daily. This will typically be the tests you choose to run as part of your regression suite. You may choose to not run certain types of tests on a daily basis.
